Folds:

1. continuous_sampling:          For continuous sampling.

2. mupath_sampling:              For mu path pattern sampling.

3. reconstruction methods:       For image reconstruction, inculding:...

                                      Compressive sensing reconstruction methods: BP, CoSaMP, SMP.
                                      Inpainting reconstruction methods: LCIS, TV.

4. support_files:                For my own use. (unnecessary to read, just test files to make sure how Labview & FPGA work)

5. trajectory files:             Sampling trajactory data.
